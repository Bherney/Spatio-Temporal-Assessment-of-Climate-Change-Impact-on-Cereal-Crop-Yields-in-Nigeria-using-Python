# Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Climate Change Impact on Cereal Crop Yields in Nigeria (Python)

This repository contains the analysis and visualization scripts for assessing the **impact of climate change on cereal crop yields (maize, sorghum, millet, wheat) across Nigerian states** under two climate scenarios:  
- **SSP3-7.0 (medium emissions)**  
- **SSP5-8.5 (high emissions)**  

The study evaluates yield projections for two future periods (**2021â€“2040** and **2041â€“2060**), compares state-level vulnerabilities, and identifies priority states for adaptation investments.

## Study Overview
- **Objective 1:** Analyze spatial variations in projected cereal yields under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5.  
- **Objective 2:** Compare vulnerability of Nigerian states to yield reductions across crops.  
- **Objective 3:** Determine priority states for climate adaptation by evaluating yield gaps between scenarios.  

**Data Source:** [CGIAR Adaptation Atlas](https://adaptationatlas.cgiar.org)
